Stanford CS106 project

This program encodes the classic arcade game of Breakout invented by Steve Wonzniak -- cofounder of Apple Inc.

In Breakout, the colored rectangles in the top part of the screen are bricks. Players need to control the paddel and bounce the ball to hit the brick. If the ball fall out of the screen, the player loses, while if the last brick is eliminated, the player wins.
